I'm passionate about **data analysis**, **data science**, and **football**, especially as a dedicated **Lille OSC** supporter. This dashboard is a **personal data science project** designed to **analyze, compare, and visualize football player performances**.

It showcases a full **end-to-end workflow**, including:

- **Web scraping** of detailed player statistics from [FBref.com](https://fbref.com), covering the **Top 5 European leagues** (*Ligue 1, Premier League, Serie A, Bundesliga, La Liga*) and the **3 major European competitions** (*UEFA Champions League, Europa League, Conference League*) — over **2100 matches per season**.
- **Data cleaning & transformation**: standardizing, enriching, and formatting raw scraped data to prepare it for analysis.
- **Advanced data analysis**: selecting key metrics by position, filtering noise, and identifying trends and patterns.
- **Custom rating algorithm**: a performance index I personally designed, combining weighted metrics by **position** and **playing time**, to deliver a **match-by-match rating**.
- **Percentile-based comparison system**: allows benchmarking players against their peers to highlight relative strengths.
- **Team analysis**: additional pages to explore club-level performance, built from scraped and processed team data.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: predicts outcomes for the three major European competitions

This dashboard brings together **statistics**, **visuals**, and **contextual insights**, all tailored for **football analysis** from a **data-driven perspective**.
